Meteor Reactive Countdown
======

Reactive Countdown is a simple library providing a reactive countdown timer.

## Install it

Install the library via the meteor command:

```meteor add flyandi:reactive-countdown```


## How to use it

See the example below to get an idea how to use this library.

```html
<template name="foo">
 
 <big>{{getCountdown}}</big> seconds left!

</template>
```

```javasscript

var countdown = new ReactiveCountdown(30);

countdown.start(function() {
	
	// do something when this is completed

});

Template.foo.helpers({
		
	getCountdown: function() {
		return countdown.get();
	};

});
```


## Constructor

The constructor allows to pass the initial value of the countdown (e.g. in seconds) and a optional settings structure. The settings can override the behavior of the countdown, e.g. instead of seconds use half seconds, etc.

```javascript
new ReactiveCountdown(<countdown>, <settings>);

var countdown = new ReactiveCountdown(30, {
  
  // Value substracted every tick from the current countdown value
  steps: 1,  

  // Specify the countdown's interval in milliseconds
  interval: 1000,

  // Callback: Tick, called on every interval
  tick: function() {},

  // Callback: Complete, called when the countdown has reached 0
  completed: function() {},

});
```

Examples for constructors:

```javascript
	
	// use half seconds for countdown

	var halfSecondCountdown = new ReactiveCountdown(30, {
		interval: 500, 
	});

	// run countdown every 5s
	var fiveSecondCountdown = new ReactiveCountdown(60, {

		interval: 5000,

		step: 5,
	});

```


## Methods

```javascript
 .start(<completed>, <tick>);
```

Resets the countdown and starts it. Optional allows to override the callbacks **completed** and **tick**.


```javascript
 .stop();
```

Stops the countdown. Doesn't execute any callbacks.


```javascript
 .add(<number>);
```

Adds the amount specified to the countdown value. Useful when the countdown value needs to be dynamically adjusted.


```javascript
 .remove(<number>);
```

Removes the amount specified from the countdown value. 


```javascript
 .get();
```

Returns the current value of the countdown. This method is reactive.


```javascript
 .getFormattedObject();
```

Returns the current value of the countdown as an object containing ```days```, ```hours```, ```minutes``` and ```seconds```.


```javascript
 .getFormattedString(<format>, <showZero>);
```

Returns the current value of the countdown as a formatted string. The method allows to specify the output format and pad single digit values with a ```0``` if needed.

The default format is ```%D days %H hours %M minutes %S seconds``` where ```%D``` is replaced with the current **days**, ```%H``` is replaced with the **hours**, ```%M``` is replaced with the **minutes** and ```%S``` is replaced with the **seconds**.

If single digit numbers require padding (prepending 0), specify it with `%DD, %HH, %MM or %SS`.

There may be cases where you prefer not to display a number when it is 0. To do so, just enclose it within `<!` and `>` and it is done. Moreover, whatever you enclose within `<!` and `>` will be removed from the output string. eg. `<!%HH hours >%MM minutes %SS seconds` will result in say `05 minutes 20 seconds` and not `00 hours 05 minutes 20 seconds` when hours is 0.
